# THE PROBLEM:
Cattle perform a major role in helping farmers in agriculture especially in a country like India. Most of the farmers use cattle to plough the land to grow crops. Cattle also give us organic manure to keep the farm land good and fertile for farming. So, protecting cattle is the also as equally important as protecting crops. Nowadays, all the living things on earth are subjected towards various diseases and viruses. And statistically most of them are infective and they spread by means of physical contact. One of those viruses is lumpy virus which is affecting cows and buffaloes. If a non-infected cow drinks water from the same source from where infected cattle drinks water the virus spreads. If one such problem is existing right now; we can expect ten more in the future. Hence, to prevent the spreading of these kind of viruses we have come up with an idea called Hay and water dispenser for cattle.

# THE TEAMS APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM: -
Our bot consists of two boxes made up of waterproof wood. They will be aligned side by side. One wooden box will be used for storing dispensed hay and one will be used for storing water. The hay we will be using must be rolled up in order to make it easy while releasing it. The bot will be programmed so as to dispense one hay roll and a few litres of water every 6 hours. To dispense the hay roll we will be using a conveyor belt on which a few hay rolls will be placed at uniform distances. And the conveyor belt will be powered using a DC motor. So, every 6 hours the motor will be switched on to push the hay roll into the wooden box. For water we need a water source from where water will be pumped into the water box. A Solenoid valve will be used to let the water into the water box. Every 6 hours the solenoid
valve will be switched on till the required amount of water is poured into the box. In this way we can avoid the spreading of viruses and a farmer can save his time and energy too.

# What do you feel is the most innovative part of the problem?
We feel that the most innovative part our project is that it decreases human labor you can stack our project with hay and water sufficient for 2-3 days and not worry about feeding the cattle and it also reduces the risk of spreading of the viruses like lumpy virus in the cattle by avoiding contact among cattle during feeding them and also by reducing the physical contact of humans it also reduces the risk of spreading diseases which can be caused by contact with the animals.

# Working

# Result :
Our project demonstrated the mentioned working successfully. The code generated from ESP8266 Node MCU established connection with the Motor and Solenoid Valve, through which the Hay and Water are dispersed to the cattle’s for every 6 hours.

# Future Enhancements :
Our bot might be still at prototype level but it can be upgraded with many more features like adding a camera so
that the user can ensure that the hay and water has been dispersed to the cattle’s. Our idea can also be implemented in large scale places where a group of chambers can be setup in a single cow-barn, with the above mentioned technology so that the cattle man can easily check the hay or water of a particular cattle in their respective chamber.

# Conclusion :
Our Dispenser has a very much potential in the market. It helps many individuals in the time of any infectious disease who are having cattle as it helps the individual in not being in contact with the cattle and providing food and water without infecting the cattle or himself.
